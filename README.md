# Zilliqa-gen

I have created a collection of avatar which is inspired by the Zilliqa.

This is a generative art project which is capable of producing more than 350,000+ zilliqa avatars and each of them will have distinct characteristics. For you example I am attaching 500 avatars.

## Idea behind this project

* I have followed the rainbow pride color scheme to promote the equality among all the genders (I added black because it looked good!!).
* There exists different distinct characteristics, they are as numbered:

Hairs - 7 traits

Body suit - 7 traits

Cape - 7 traits

Shoes - 7 traits

Belt - 7 traits

Skin - 3 traits

Background - 7 traits

* Each background actually represents one among the 7 continents, describing that Zilliqa is spread worldwide.
